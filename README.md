# tic-tac-toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe game features a 3x3 grid where players alternately place X or O in each cell. The HTML sets up the game board and controls, while CSS styles the grid, adds colors, and animates winning cells. JavaScript manages game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and game status updates. Players click cells to make their moves, and the game detects winners or a draw based on predefined winning conditions. A restart button allows players to reset the game. The UI includes a status display and responsive design, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.
